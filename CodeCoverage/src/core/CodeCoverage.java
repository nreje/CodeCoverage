 * Simple Code Coverage Checking Toolâ„¢ that redirects the error stream to a custom one that extracts relevant error outputs.
 * 
 * Write System.err.println("#CC# {line ID}"); where {line ID} is an identifier for some line that you want to check the coverage for.
 * The {line ID} could contain whatever you want so long as it works for you.
 * 
 * Because the lines are kept in a set there are no guarantees that they will come in the order they where put there.
